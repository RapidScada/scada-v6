<h1>Migrate Configuration to New Server</h1>

<p>The typical tasks when Rapid SCADA migration to another server is needed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The software deployment on a production server when the configuration has been completed using a developer workstation.</li>
    <li>Server replacement.</li>
</ul>

<p>The steps to migrate a configuration are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Ensure that connections between the server and the devices are properly configured: the required serial ports exist, industrial controllers available via the network, etc.</li>
    <li>Install Rapid SCADA on the new server, but do not start the Server and Communicator services.</li>
    <li>Stop the Server and Communicator services on the obsolete server. Switch startup type of these services to Manual.</li>
    <li>
        Copy the data archive located in the following directories from the obsolete server to the new server:<br />
        C:\SCADA\ArchiveDAT<br />
        C:\SCADA\ArchiveDATCopy
    </li>
    <li>
        Transfer the configuration from the obsolete to the new server in one of the following ways.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Copy the content of the directories listed below from the obsolete to the new server (default directories are shown):<br />
                C:\SCADA\BaseDAT<br />
                C:\SCADA\Interface<br />
                C:\SCADA\Projects<br />
                C:\SCADA\ScadaAgent\Config<br />
                C:\SCADA\ScadaComm\Config<br />
                C:\SCADA\ScadaServer\Config<br />
                C:\SCADA\ScadaWeb\config<br />
                C:\SCADA\ScadaWeb\storage
            </li>
            <li>Open the project in the Administrator application and upload the configuration to the new server with the <img src="../common-images/upload.png" /> button, unchecking the <em>Restart Server</em> and <em>Restart Communicator</em> checkboxes.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Start the Server and Communicator services on the new server.</li>
    <li>Check whether the new server operates well.</li>
</ol>
