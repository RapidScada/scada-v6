<h1>Software Update</h1>

<p>Updating Rapid SCADA to new versions has to be performed on the test environment first. Carefully read <a href="../version-history/scada-history">the list of changes were made in the new version</a>. If the configuration database structure is changed or the archive or configuration files formats are changed, special utility is required to convert data.</p>

<p>Installation on the production server is allowed only being sure that the new version of Rapid SCADA operates properly on the test environment.</p>

<p>The steps for updating Rapid SCADA:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make a backup copy of the all files of Rapid SCADA located in C:\SCADA directory by default.</li>
    <li>Uninstall Rapid SCADA using the installer ScadaSetup.exe.</li>
    <li>Install a new version of Rapid SCADA and <a href="migrate-configuration">migrate the configuration</a> from the backup copy.</li>
    <li>Clear the browser cache or refresh the web application pages by pressing Shift + F5.</li>
</ol>

<p>Updating Rapid SCADA by directly copying files of a new version is technically possible. However, this operation requires a deep understanding of Rapid SCADA and can cause errors in the software.</p>
