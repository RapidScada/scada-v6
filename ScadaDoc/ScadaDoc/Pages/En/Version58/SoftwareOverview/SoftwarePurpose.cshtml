    <h1>Software Purpose and Characteristics</h1>
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Rapid SCADA provides creation of automated systems of the following types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Industrial automation systems.</li>
        <li>Home automation systems.</li>
        <li>Energy accounting systems.</li>
        <li>Security and fire alarm systems.</li>
        <li>Access control systems.</li>
        <li>Any systems that contain controllers, sensors and relays.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Rapid SCADA is a software that automatically collects data communicating with controllers, processes data and provides information to a dispatcher. Rapid SCADA supports commonly used communication standards such as Modbus protocol and OPC that allow using a huge amount of various devices. The list of supported devices can be extended by developing additional drivers.</p>
    <p>Rapid SCADA consists of the set of application and libraries. The software is a platform which allows flexible system configuration to meet the customer needs. Rapid SCADA is open source software, its internal data formats and communication protocols are documented. This approach simplifies integration of Rapid SCADA with other applications to create complex enterprise-wide solutions. Functionality of Rapid SCADA can be enhanced by adding custom modules which implement required features.</p>
    <p>Access to information and control functions in Rapid SCADA is restricted according to user rights. The ability to use Active Directory for user authentication significantly increases the safety of storing passwords. User rights management using Active Directory eliminates the system administrator from manual input user logins and passwords.</p>
