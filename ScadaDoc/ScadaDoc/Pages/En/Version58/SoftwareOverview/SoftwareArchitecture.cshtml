<h1>Software Architecture</h1>
<p>The architecture of Rapid SCADA is multi-tier and distributed (see Figure 1). Applications can run on a single server or multiple computers across a network. Controllers can use communication channels of different types for connecting to a system. Major factors that determine the system configuration are number of equipment locations, distance between them, estimation of end-user activity, restrictions of external systems.</p>

<p>Rapid SCADA includes the following main applications:</p>
<ol>
    <li><em>Webstation</em> is a web application that displays information to a dispatcher via browser in different forms (tabular, schematic, diagrams, reports) and provides sending commands.</li>
    <li><em>Server</em> manages the data archives, performs mathematical calculations and provides information to the client applications.</li>
    <li><em>Communicator</em> interacts with controllers, transmits data to <em>Server</em> application.</li>
</ol>
<p>Providing data access using web technology significantly simplifies the deployment and maintenance of the system, which is especially important for a large number of users.</p>
<p>Commonly used devices controlled by a system are electricity meters, heat meters, fire and security alarms, access controllers and other equipment.</p>
