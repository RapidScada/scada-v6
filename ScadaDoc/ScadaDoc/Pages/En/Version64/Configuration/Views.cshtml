    <h1>Views</h1>
    <p><strong>View</strong> is a form of data representation in the Webstation application. There are 3 types of views supported by default: table views, mimic diagrams and web pages. Support for other types of views can be added by installing additional plugins. A complete list of implemented view types is contained in the <strong>View types</strong> table of the configration database.</p>

    <h2 id="creating-views">Creating Views</h2>
    <p>View files are located in the <strong>Views</strong> section of a project. To create a file or folder in the views section, right-click on the explorer node in this section, then select <strong>New File</strong> or <strong>New Folder</strong> from the context menu that appears (see Figure 1).</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Figure 1. View context menu</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>When creating a file, select a view type in the dialog box, specify a file name and click <strong>OK</strong> (see Figure 2). The created file will appear in the project explorer. Double-clicking opens the view in an editor corresponding to the file extension.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>There are specialized editor applications for table views and mimic diagrams. Other types of view files are in XML format and can be edited using general-purpose text editors.</p>

    <h2 id="view-table">View Table</h2>
    <p>After a view file is created, it must be registered in the configuration database in the <strong>Views</strong> table, as shown in Figure 3. Subfolders in which the view files are located must also be listed in the table in order to assign access rights to them.</p>

    <p><strong>Path</strong> to a view is relative to the views directory. Regardless of the operating system used on the server, the path separator is a backslash. Some views, such as <strong>Web page</strong> views, do not have a view file. For such views, specify a path that determines the location of the view in the view explorer of the Webstation application.</p>
    <p><strong>View Type</strong> is selected from a drop-down list. If a view file has an extension registered in the View types table, then view type does not need to be specified because it will be determined automatically.</p>
    <p>An <strong>Object</strong> whose data is displayed by the view must be specified to configure access rights.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Arguments</strong> column contains additional view parameters that that the behavior of the view. For views of the <strong>Web page</strong> type, a page address is specified as arguments.</p>
    <p>A <strong>Title</strong> specified for a view is displayed in the view tree. If the title is blank, the file name is used as the title.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Order</strong> numeric field determines the order in which views are processed when generating the view explorer. If no order is specified, views are processed in the order of their IDs.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Hide</strong> checkbox allows to hide a view from the view explorer. This is useful for auxiliary views that are opened by a link from other views.</p>

    <p>Based on the view table under consideration, the view explorer is populated, which is shown in Figure 4.</p>
