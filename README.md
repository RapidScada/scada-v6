# Rapid SCADA version 6
Rapid SCADA is an open source industrial automation platform. The out of the box software provides tools for rapid creation of monitoring and control systems. In case of large implementation, Rapid SCADA is used as a core for development of custom SCADA and MES solutions for a Customer.

Open source is the key to software transparency and security. The licensing model permits creation of new derivative software products.

Rapid SCADA is a perfect choice for creating large distributed industrial automation systems. Rapid SCADA runs on servers, embedded computers and in the cloud. Rapid SCADA nodes exchange information between themselves, and interact with external databases in real time.

The main classes of systems developed using Rapid SCADA are the following:

* Industrial automation systems and IIoT systems.
* Process control systems.
* Energy accounting systems.
